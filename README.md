# AstroBros
This is my repository for the 2015-2016 libGDX game jam

Feel free to use this project as a learning opportunity. My way of doing things certainly isn't the best since this is my first game that I'm trying to complete by myself entirely.

The game is called AstroBros. The goal is to get all of the bros into orbit in the goldilocks zone before the timer runs out. You can switch between bros only if you are attached them. You can release the attachment from the currently controlled bro.
