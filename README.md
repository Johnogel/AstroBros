# AstroBros
This is my repository for the 2015-2016 libGDX game jam

Feel free to use this project as a learning opportunity. My way of doing things certainly isn't the best since this is my first game that I'm trying to complete by myself entirely.

The game is called AstroBros. The goal is to get all of the bros into orbit in the goldilocks zone before the timer runs out. Press space to attach to a bro and release space to release them. Use a combination of bumping and pulling to get them in orbit
